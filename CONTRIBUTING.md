# Contributing to the Machi project

The most helpful way to contribute is by reporting your experience
through issues. Issues may not be updated while we review internally,
but they're still incredibly appreciated.

Pull requests may take multiple engineers for verification and testing. If
you're passionate enough to want to learn more on how you can get
hands on in this process, reach out to
[Matt Brender](mailto:mbrender@basho.com), your developer advocate.

Thank you for being part of the community! We love you for it. 

## If you have a question or wish to provide design feedback/criticism

Please
[open a support ticket at GitHub](https://github.com/basho/machi/issues/new)
to ask questions and to provide feedback about Machi's
design/documentation/source code.

## General development process

Machi is still a very young project within Basho, with a small team of
developers; please bear with us as we grow out of "toddler" stage into
a more mature open source software project.

* Fork the Machi source repo and/or the sub-projects that are affected
  by your change.  
* Create a topic branch for your change and checkout that branch.
     git checkout -b some-topic-branch
* Make your changes and run the test suite if one is provided.
* Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
* Open pull-requests for the appropriate projects.
* Contributors will review your pull request, suggest changes, and merge it when itâ€™s ready and/or offer feedback.
* To report a bug or issue, please open a new issue against this repository.
