* To Do list

** DONE remove the escript* stuff from machi_util.erl
** DONE Add functions to manipulate 1-chain projections

- Add epoch ID = epoch number + checksum of projection!
  Done via compare() func.

** DONE Change all protocol ops to add epoch ID
** DONE Add projection store to each FLU.

*** DONE What should the API look like? (borrow from chain mgr PoC?)

Yeah, I think that's pretty complete.  Steal it now, worry later.

*** DONE Choose protocol & TCP port. Share with get/put? Separate?

Hrm, I like the idea of having a single TCP port to talk to any single
FLU.

To make the protocol "easy" to hack, how about using the same basic
method as append/write where there's a variable size blob.  But we'll
format that blob as a term_to_binary().  Then dispatch to a single
func, and pattern match Erlang style in that func.

*** DONE Do it.

** TODO Fix all known bugs with Chain Manager

*** DONE Fix known bugs
*** DONE Clean up crufty TODO comments and other obvious cruft
*** TODO Re-add verification step of stable epochs, including inner projections!
*** TODO Attempt to remove cruft items in flapping_i?

** TODO Finish OTP'izing the Chain Manager with FLU & proj store processes
** TODO Add gproc and get rid of registered name rendezvous
*** TODO Fixes the atom table leak
*** TODO Fixes the problem of having active sequencer for the same prefix
         on two FLUS in the same VM
** TODO Eliminate the timeout exception for the client: just {error,timeout} ret
** TODO Change all protocol ops to enforce the epoch ID
** TODO Add projection wedging logic to each FLU.

- Add no-wedging state to make testing easier?
    
** TODO Move prototype/chain-manager code to "top" of source tree
*** TODO Preserve current test code (leave as-is? tiny changes?)
*** TODO Make chain manager code flexible enough to run "real world" or "sim"
** TODO Move the FLU server to gen_server behavior?
** TODO Implement real data repair, orchestrated by the chain manager
