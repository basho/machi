# Machi

## Nota Bene

This source repo is in a state of chaotic consolidation of several
independent repos.  At the moment, none of the prototype code is
expected to work.  Perhaps it does, perhaps it doesn't.  I'll know
as I continue work in early March 2015.

Meanwhile, see the wiki for this repo for helpful hints, as time
permits.

## Initial re-porting on 'prototype' directory

* `chain-manager`: not started
* `corfurl`: in progress
* `demo-day-hack`: not started
* `tango`: not started
