# Machi

## Nota Bene

This source repo is in a state of chaotic consolidation of several
independent repos.  At the moment, none of the prototype code is
expected to work.  Perhaps it does, perhaps it doesn't.  I'll know
as we continue work in early March 2015.

Meanwhile, see the wiki for this repo for helpful hints, as time
permits.

## Initial re-porting on 'prototype' directory

* `chain-manager`: finished
* `corfurl`: finished
* `demo-day-hack`: not started
* `tango`: finished
