# Machi

## Nota Bene

This source repo is in a state of consolidation of several
independent repos.  At the moment, most of the prototype code is
expected to work -- please see the list below.

Meanwhile, see the `README`* files throughout this repo
for helpful hints.

## Initial re-porting on 'prototype' directory

* `demo-day-hack`: work started on the `slf/otp-refactoring-step2` branch
  to copy code from an internal Basho "Demo Day" from the `prototype/demo-day-hack`
  directory to the "official" top of this repo.  The end goal of this branch
  (and perhaps other branches with the `slf/otp-refactoring` prefix!) is
  to create a code base of minimal, functional Machi server & client code.
* `chain-manager`: finished
* `corfurl`: finished
* `tango`: finished
