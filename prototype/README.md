# Prototype directory

The contents of the `prototype` directory is the result of
consolidating several small & independent repos.  Originally, each
small was a separate prototype/quick hack for experimentation
purposes.  The code is preserved here for use as:

* Examples of what not to do ... the code **is** a bit ugly, after
  all.  <tt>^_^</tt>
* Some examples of what to do when prototyping in Erlang.  For
  example, "Let it crash" style coding is so nice to hack on quickly.
* Some code might actually be reusable, as-is or after some
  refactoring.

## The chain-manager prototype

## The corfurl prototype

The `corfurl` code is a mostly-complete complete implementation of the
CORFU server & client specification.  More details on the papers about
CORFU are mentioned in the `corfurl/docs/corfurl.md` file.

This code contains a QuickCheck + PULSE test.  If you wish to use it,
please note the usage instructions and restrictions mentioned in the
`README.md` file.
