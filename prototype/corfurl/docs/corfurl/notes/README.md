## read-repair-race.1.

First attempt at using "mscgen" to make some Message Sequence
Chart (MSC) for a race found at commit 087c2605ab.


## read-repair-race.2.

Second attempt.  This is almost exactly the trace that is
generated by this failing test case at commit 087c2605ab:

    C2 = [{1,2,1},{{[{set,{var,1},{call,corfurl_pulse,setup,[1,2,1,standard]}}],[[{set,{var,3},{call,corfurl_pulse,append,[{var,1},<<0>>]}}],[{set,{var,2},{call,corfurl_pulse,read_approx,[{var,1},6201864198]}},{set,{var,5},{call,corfurl_pulse,append,[{var,1},<<0>>]}}],[{set,{var,4},{call,corfurl_pulse,append,[{var,1},<<0>>]}},{set,{var,6},{call,corfurl_pulse,trim,[{var,1},510442857]}}]]},{25152,1387,78241}},[{events,[[{no_bad_reads,[]}]]}]].
    eqc:check(corfurl_pulse:prop_pulse(), C2).

## read-repair-race.2b.*

Same basic condition as read-repair-race.2, but edited
substantially to make it clearer what is happening.
Also for commit 087c2605ab.

I believe that I have a fix for the silver-colored
`error-overwritten`, but the correctness of it remains to be seen.
