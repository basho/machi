The corfurl code is in the 'src' and 'include' directories.  In
addition, there are docs here:

https://github.com/basho/corfurl/blob/master/docs/corfurl.md

This is a README-style collection of CORFU-related papers,
building instructions, and testing instructions.

https://github.com/basho/corfurl/tree/master/docs/corfurl/notes#two-clients-try-to-write-the-exact-same-data-at-the-same-time-to-the-same-lpn

The above are some notes about testing problems & solutions that
I was/am/?? hoping might find their way into a paper someday.
