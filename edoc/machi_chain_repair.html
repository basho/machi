<h2><a name="description">Description</a></h2><p>Perform "chain repair", i.e., resynchronization of Machi file

  <p>The implementation here is a very basic one, and is probably a bit
  slower than the original "demo day" implementation at

  <p>It's so easy to bikeshed this into a 1 year programming exercise.</p>
 
  <p>General TODO note: There are a lot of areas for exploiting parallelism here.
  I've set the bikeshed aside for now, but "make repair faster" has a
  lot of room for exploiting concurrency, overlapping reads &amp; writes,  
etc etc.  There are also lots of different trade-offs to make with  
regard to RAM use vs. disk use.</p>
 
  <p>There's no reason why repair can't be done:</p>
 
  <ol>
  <li> Repair in parallel across multiple repairees ... Optimization.
  </li>
  <li> Repair multiple byte ranges concurrently ... Optimization.
  </li>
  <li><p> Use bigger chunks than the client originally used to write the file     
... Optimization ... but it would be the easiest to implement, e.g. use     
constant-sized 4MB chunks.  Unfortuntely, it would also destroy     
the ability to verify here that the chunk checksums are correct     
*and* also propagate the correct checksum metadata to the     
destination FLU.</p>
 
     As an additional optimization, add a bit of #2 to start the next
     read while the current write is still in progress.
  </li>
  <li> The current method centralizes the "smarts" required to compare
     checksum differences ... move some computation to each FLU, then use
     a Merkle- or other-compression-style scheme to reduce the amount of
     data sent across a network.
  </li>
  </ol>
 
  <p>Most/all of this could be executed in parallel on each FLU relative to  
its own files.  Then, in another TODO option, perhaps build a Merkle tree  
or other summary of the local files and send that data structure to the  
repair coordinator.</p>
 
  <p>Also, as another TODO note, repair_both_present() in the  
prototype/demo-day code uses an optimization of calculating the MD5  
checksum of the chunk checksum data as it arrives, and if the two MD5s  
match, then we consider the two files in sync.  If there isn't a match,  
then we sort the lines and try another MD5, and if they match, then we're  
in sync.  In theory, that's lower overhead than the procedure used here.</p>
 
  NOTE that one reason I chose the "directives list" method is to have an
  option, later, of choosing to repair a subset of repairee FLUs if there
  is a big discrepency between out of sync files: e.g., if FLU x has N
  bytes out of sync but FLU y has 50N bytes out of sync, then it's likely
  better to repair x only so that x can return to the UPI list quickly.
  Also, in the event that all repairees are roughly comparably out of sync,
  then the repair network traffic can be minimized by reading each chunk
  only once.
